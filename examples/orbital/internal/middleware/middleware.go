// Package middleware holds the wrappers orbital itself puts around its
// handlers: an --out redirection that every command in the binary runs
// inside, and an audit check that only the commands changing fleet state
// do.
//
// Both are climux.Middleware, so neither is registered by the handler it
// wraps. main.go declares Output on the root, which inherits down the
// whole tree, and each mutating command declares Audit on itself; a
// read-only command such as "deploy status" declares nothing and so is
// not audited. That is the point of the mechanism here: the platform team
// owns what wraps a handler without touching the team that wrote it.
//
// A wrapper belonging to a shared library goes in that library instead,
// registered beside the flags it reads -- see internal/telemetry, whose
// Timing wrapper arrives with --trace rather than being declared here.
