// Package telemetry stands in for a platform library that every team's
// binary links in for logging and tracing. It contributes the way a
// shared library should: a settings struct with a FlagGroup method, and
// the middleware that honors those flags, registered together into
// climux.DefaultRegistry so that any command mounting that registry picks
// up both. Registering them as one unit is the point -- --trace cannot be
// mounted into a binary that forgot to wrap its handlers, so the flag
// means the same thing everywhere.
