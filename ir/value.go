// Value is the interface to the dynamic value stored in a flag.
// (The default value is represented as a string.)
//
// Set is called once, in command line order, for each flag present. In
// POSIX terms, s is the option-argument written after an option, or the
// operand bound to a positional flag.
//
// This is Go's flag.Value without String, so a value already written for
// the flag package satisfies it and may be bound with xflags.Var
// unchanged. String is not required because a compiled flag carries its
// default already rendered, captured when the flag was constructed. The
// likeness stops at the interface: command lines are POSIX/GNU and not
// the flag package's dialect, so a program migrating keeps its values and
// changes the arguments its users type.

// BoolValue is an optional interface to indicate boolean flags that can be
// supplied without a "=value" argument.
//
// It names the flag package's IsBoolFlag convention. A value reporting
// true is an option that takes no option-argument, so naming it alone
// stands for true and a following argument is left as an operand. It
// still accepts a value attached with "=", which is how "--verbose=false"
// sets false; that much follows Go rather than getopt_long.

// Kind classifies the value a flag or positional argument takes, coarser
// than the Go type behind it: a command line accepts a decimal integer
// whether the variable it is bound to is an int or an int64, and Kind
// names what a program means by the flag rather than how it is built. It
// is written as its own string, so a kind added later is a new constant
// rather than a change to how one already written is read.

// twice yields the same values; a value implementing Resetter is restored
// by Reset, and any other by re-applying the default its flag's
// constructor captured.
