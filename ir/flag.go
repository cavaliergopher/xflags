// Claim is what naming a flag by one option on the command line means:
// Source is the declared option the parser resolves it to -- itself, if
// the option was declared outright, or the option a convention generated
// it from -- and Effect is what the convention says naming it this way
// does to the value, such as "negate" for the boolean opposite
// getopt_long-style conventions write. Absent, the effect is the
// ordinary one: naming the flag this way sets it.
//
// Effect is a word the convention that wrote it defines and a reader
// consumes; nothing in this package or the root package may compare it
// against a value either knows. The parser derives what it needs to know
// about a claim, such as negation, by running its own generating rule
// forward against Source instead; see internal/argv's
// resolvedOptionsInto.

	// NamedOptions is the option each name the program declared is shown

	// parallel to those names, in the order
	// climux.Flag.Aliases documents -- the canonical name, the short
	// name, then any further aliases -- so a slot a flag left empty stays
	// empty here rather than closing up, and a help formatter can print
	// the first two knowing what they are.
	//
	// A positional argument has none. It is an operand rather than an
	// option, so nothing names it on the command line and ValueName is
	// how it is shown.
	//
	// Not every option a parser accepts appears here, so this is what is
	// worth showing rather than an exhaustive account of what matches;
	// see ClaimedOptions.
	NamedOptions []string

	// ClaimedOptions is every option the flag answers to on the command
	// line, each mapped to a Claim naming the option it came from and
	// what naming the flag that way means. Where NamedOptions is what a
	// reader is shown, this is what a reader may type, and the two differ
	// once an option is generated: a boolean answers to --no-verbose,
	// claimed with Source "--verbose", without that belonging beside the
	// flag's synonyms in help.
	//
	// It is the enumerable half of what matches, not the whole of it. A
	// convention may also match by rule -- every casing of an option, or
	// every unambiguous prefix of one -- and no map can hold those, so
	// completion offers from this while the command line still accepts
	// more. Every entry of NamedOptions appears here; Validate checks it,
	// since a convention showing an option it will not accept is a bug in
	// the convention rather than in the program that declared the flag.
	//
	// A positional argument claims none, answering to no option at all.
	ClaimedOptions map[string]Claim

	// Name is the flag's declared canonical name, undecorated by any
	// dialect: "force" rather than "--force". A positional argument's
	// Name is the name it was declared with, same as any other flag.
	//
	// It identifies the flag independent of how any one option is
	// spelled or ordered, which NamedOptions and ClaimedOptions are not:
	// both are keyed, or ordered, by a dialect's decoration.
	Name string

	// ValueName is how the value the flag takes is written where the flag
	// is shown to a reader: the "SERVICE" of "Usage: deploy SERVICE" and
	// of "missing required argument: SERVICE", and the placeholder beside
	// an option that takes one. Where NamedOptions says what a reader
	// types to name the flag, this says what they type after it -- so a
	// positional argument, which names no option and is only its value,
	// is shown by this alone.
	//
	// Like NamedOptions it arrives already written, so a formatter prints it as
	// given. Both the name it is taken from and the convention it is
	// written by belong to whatever reads the command line, which is what
	// lets one convention print SERVICE where another prints <service>. A
	// flag that takes no value has none.

	// positional argument, reports true.
	TakesValue bool

	// HasDefault records that Default was captured from a live Value, so
	// it may be re-applied to restore it. See Resetter for the
	// alternative a Value offers when Set cannot restore its default by

	// Handler, if set, makes the flag an interrupt: naming it on the
	// command line ends the parse there and runs this in place of the
	// handler of the command that was active, which is the command the
	// resulting Invocation names.
	//
	// Nothing after the interrupt is read, and nothing the command line
	// said is checked -- not the flag rules, not the environment
	// variables -- so an interrupt answers even a command line that is
	// otherwise wrong. That is what lets the flag asking for help print
	// it beside a typo rather than reporting the typo instead.
