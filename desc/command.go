// Command describes a command that users may invoke from the command
// line: its own name, the flags it accepts and every subcommand beneath
// it.
//
// A Command names only the flags declared or mounted on it, not those
// inherited from an ancestor. A flag is in scope for a command from the
// point its own command is named onward, so an ancestor's flags are not
// repeated on each of its descendants; see the machine-readable-schema
// ADR.

	// Name is the command's own name, unqualified by its ancestry: "add"
	// rather than "orbital remote add".
