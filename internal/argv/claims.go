// printing and the second for matching, and they part company as soon as
// a dialect writes an option no name asked for.

// Both halves are this dialect's to decide, so a caller hands over what
// the program declared and takes back the whole answer rather than

// so it is written as no option and claims none; only a boolean option
// has an opposite worth naming. Nothing outside this package settles
// either question.

// be something a program remembers to switch on. Compile calls this once,
// while lowering, so the result is what everything downstream reads;
